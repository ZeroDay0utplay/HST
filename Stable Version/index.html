            <h3 class="sub-tit">‚Ä¢ Malware Development &#128126;</h3>
            <p class="para">I worked on some Advanced Persistent malware projects using Python && C && C++ like a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) which had too many functionalities like a reverse shell, opening target camera, capturing keystrokes, screen recording, upload/download files && a CryptoMiner that mines cryptocurrency (XMR) for the attacker with a specified number of threads (Less suspicious in CPU usage) && a KeyLogger that captures KeyStrokes from the target computer and send with 2 options (with sockets OR over email)</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="sub-tit">‚Ä¢ Ethical Hacking üê±‚Äçüíª</h3>
            <p class="para">I had a basic level in penetration testing, I can scan the network of a system using NMAP , discover open ports, Googole search for vunlerabilities for the services of each port, find an exploit for the vunlerability and get into the system and finally search for a privilige escalation technique to get into the root user(HIGHEST PRIVILIGE like adminstrator in Windows) and had full control of the target system. I also had some knowledge in Wi-fi hacking, wordlist brute force password using aircrack-ng OR by WPS pin hacking, WPS is a 8 digits number (much less combinations (10^8) than Wi-fi password) used to easy connect to access points without typing the password. And when we are in the network we can use tools like BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) which is used for client-side attack vectors like URL Redirection, faking web pages (logins for example) && Packet Sniffing using Wireshark && much much more things.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-tit">‚Ä¢ CTF player &#128681;</h3>
            <p class="para">Capture The Flag or CTF for short is a Security Hacking game made for hackers to exercise and develop their skills, the concept is to find the flag which is hidden in vunlerable system, the goal is to find this vunlerability and exploit it to had access to the system, there are 2 categories of CTF attack/defense (Competitors steal flags either from other competitors) && jeopardy (competitors from the organizers).For me, I don't play too much, I consider myself a normal player with basic skills but I like it too much.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-tit">‚Ä¢ CP && Problem Solving &#128030;</h3>
            <p class="para">I consider that problem solving is critical skill needed to be a good programmer, the programming language is not the most important thing. Good Knowledge of algorithms and data structures is the key to get an efficient solution to reduce time (Fast Loading) and money (Less Hardware usage). Competitive Programmming or CP for short is mind sport for programmers to solve mathematical or logical problems using computer programming with some constraints in RAM and runtime and the size of elements. For me, I compete always in CP contests like CodeForces or UVA online judge. These contests develop my logical thinking to find the best and efficient solution always.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-tit">‚Ä¢ Web Development &#127760;</h3>
            <p class="para">For Web Development, I started this year learning it, so I'm new to it. I took a Udemy course by The App Brewery made for beginners and I learned too much for both front && back end development. For the front end part, I learned basic HTML, CSS and it's framework Boostrap && JS and it's framewrok jQuery, I worked on many projects like The Simon Game and Dice game. For the back end part, I learned NodeJS and it's framework Express and worked on some projects. I didn't finish the course yet but I'm too close, the remaining parts are about Database.</p>
