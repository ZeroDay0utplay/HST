        <h2>&#9760; Security Background &#9760;</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Malware Development &#128126;</h3>
        <p class="sp">I worked on some Advanced Persistent malware projects using Python && C && C++ like an RAT (Remote Access Trojan) which had too many functionalities like a reverse shell, opening camera, capturing keystrokes, screen recording, upload/download files && a CryptoMiner that mines cryptocurrency (XMR) for the attacker with a specified number of threads (Less suspicious in CPU usage) && a KeyLogger that capture KeyStrokes from the target computer and send with 2 options (with sockets OR over email)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>CTF player &#128681;</h3>
        <p class="sp">Capture The Flag or CTF for short is a Security Hacking game made for hackers to exercise and develop their skills, the concept is by by finding the flag which is hidden in vunlerable system, the goal is to find this vunlerability and exploit it to had access to the system, there are 2 categories of CTF attack/defense (Competitors steal flags either from other competitors) && jeopardy (competitors from the organizers).For me, I don't played too much, I consider myself a normal player with basic skills.</p>

        <h2>&#128421; Software Development Background &#128421;</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Web Development &#127760;</h3>
        <p class="sp">For Web Development, I started this year learning it, so I'm new to it. I took a Udemy course by The App Brewery made for beginners and I learned too much for both front && back end development. For the front end part, I learned basic HTML, CSS and it's framework Boostrap && JS and it's framewrok jQuery, I worked on many projects like The Simon Game and Dice game. For the back end part, I learned NodeJS and it's framework Express and worked on some projects. I didn't finish the course yet but I'm too close, the remaining parts are about Database.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Competitive Programming && Problem Solving &#128030;</h3>
        <p class="sp">I consider that problem solving is critical skill needed to be a good programmer, the programming language is not the most important thing. Good Knowledge of algorithms and data structures is the key to get an efficient solution to reduce time (Fast Loading) and money (Less Hardware usage). I compete always in CP contests like CodeForces or UVA online judge. These contests develop my logical thinking to find the best solution always.</p>
